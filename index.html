                        <div class="col1-2"><div class="borderline"></div><p>&#8220;Katherine&#8217;s acupuncture treatments helped me recover from numerous ailments, including neck and back pain, anxiety due to work and relationship stressors, and a general lack of physical energy. She was always present with my immediate needs and provided immediate relief while helping me address the underlying causes of my discomfort. She is a true healer and her work is completely effective.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>50 year old woman - perimenopausal symptoms, back and neck pain and stress.</strong></p></div><div class="col1-2"><div class="borderline"></div><p>&#8220;I have been to four different acupuncturists and Katherine is the best. She combines gentle touch with professional confidence. Just talking to her makes me feel better and the treatment finishes the job.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>61 year old woman - Parkinson's symptoms and general health maintenance.</strong></p></div><div class="clear"></div><br/><div class="col1-2"><div class="borderline"></div><p>&#8220;Wonderful relaxing treatment. Always look forward to it.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>29 year old woman - stress and general health well-being support.</strong></p></div><div class="col1-2"><div class="borderline"></div><p>&#8220;Katherine&#8217;s care has been a godsend for me. She has been of enormous help with a wide variety of problems. She is a loving, giving and healing person and has much improved the quality of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>80 year old woman - arthritis and general health maintenance.</strong></p></div><div class="clear"></div><br/><div class="col1-2"><div class="borderline"></div><p>&#8220;I came to see Katherine after 2 years of struggling with infertility and 2 failed IVF cycles. I was desperate and exhausted but Katherine&#8217;s wisdom helped me to develop a new perspective on my struggles and to regain hope. By deeply integrating the body and mind she guided my focus to where energy was blocked and why I&#8217;d been stuck. My work with her was profoundly transformative and I will be eternally grateful to her, not only for my beautiful new daughter, but also for the way her kindness, support and insight guided me to a richer understanding of life.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>42 year old woman - fertility and general health and well-being support.</strong></p></div><div class="col1-2"><div class="borderline"></div><p>&#8220;Working with Katherine on treating my ulcerative colitis with acupuncture has enabled me to deal with my illness without the side effects caused by the prescription medications I had been taking. She has a warm and calming personality and I thoroughly looked forward to our treatment sessions. I believe acupuncture has kept me mostly symptom free for over 6 years.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>40 year old man - ulcerative colitis for 20 years.</strong></p></div><div class="clear"></div><br/><div class="col1-2"><div class="borderline"></div><p>&#8220;I was suffering with chronic sinusitis, using nasal steroid sprays continuously. I had completed 3 months of antibiotics and had taken oral steroids for 10 days. When I stopped the medicines, all my sinus symptoms returned. Then I decided to try acupuncture with Katherine. I have been receiving acupuncture for approximately 2 months now and the benefits have been tremendous; the symptoms are much better. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has sinus problems.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>36 year old man - chronic sinusitis.</strong></p></div><div class="col1-2"><div class="borderline"></div><p>&#8220;When I first started seeing Katherine I had been trying to get pregnant for five years. She worked with me emotionally and physically to help me strengthen and rebalance which allowed me to carry a healthy baby to term. My daughter is now five years old and I am so grateful for the work Katherine did with me to bring this lovely being into the world.&#8221;</p>
